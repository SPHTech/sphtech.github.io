He observed that these old companies are inclined to view technology as a hammer, to nail each and all kinds of problems with it.

A Product Owner should not be invoking the “boogeyman” tactic to scare developers into getting things done, and needs to listen to inputs from others, before deciding and forming one’s own opinions on what are the right things to do. The Product Owner should be given the autonomy and power to make decisions since he/she is responsible for the product.

This is to ensure that the small little components are thought through and taken care of. Do listen to the presenter’s example! A member of the audience also pointed out a feature not taken care of by the user story (24:45 mark), hence the need to also think about negative test criteria — what happens when the desired outcome does not happen. In this particular example, “what happens when Mei Ling searches for a product that is not in the inventory.” This is really a good reminder for everyone in our operations.</p>\n<h3>“Have the movie played out in your mind”</h3>\n<p>Another captivating concept raised by the presenter, is that for the Product Owner to steer the direction of the product, he/she should have envisioned how the end product is going to look and feel like — in the presenter’s analogy, the director having the whole movie played out in his mind before entering the studio to direct the shoot.</p>\n<p>I agree with the presenter almost whole-heartedly, except that when we put matters into context, the Product Owner is required to please the needs of the stakeholders/funders and not just the end users. From time to time, the stakeholders can be vague in terms of what they want, expecting the Product Owner to make sense of the fuzziness and deliver the desired. Hence I feel, everyone — not just the scrum team, but also the stakeholders — can take a tip or two from the process of writing Gherkin user stories, to better communicate their needs, goals and plans to fellow colleagues. Help our Product Owners, and we can grow our products together!</p>\n<p>In any case, this is only the 2nd parter of a 4-part series.

A member of the audience also pointed out a feature not taken care of by the user story (24:45 mark), hence the need to also think about negative test criteria — what happens when the desired outcome does not happen.

Hence I feel, everyone — not just the scrum team, but also the stakeholders — can take a tip or two from the process of writing Gherkin user stories, to better communicate their needs, goals and plans to fellow colleagues.

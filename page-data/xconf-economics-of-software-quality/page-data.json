However, because it was built with proper workflows and steady foundations, it would quickly catch up and surpass the growth rate of the former project steadily.</p>\n<p>He gave another analogy of how software development can be viewed as a bank account with existing debts. When each new feature is built on to the software, one can choose either to incur more debt on top of this principal amount, or pay off a portion of it: that choice depends on the quality of the code that implemented the feature.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n    <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/cb7b1025c7567d8ecdb83d4d9573d5d7/5fd2a/IMG__0314.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 1170px;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 44.57142857142857%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Technical Debt: we can choose to start paying it off, or incur more interest.\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/cb7b1025c7567d8ecdb83d4d9573d5d7/64a7b/IMG__0314.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/cb7b1025c7567d8ecdb83d4d9573d5d7/57443/IMG__0314.jpg 293w,\n/static/cb7b1025c7567d8ecdb83d4d9573d5d7/bedd3/IMG__0314.jpg 585w,\n/static/cb7b1025c7567d8ecdb83d4d9573d5d7/64a7b/IMG__0314.jpg 1170w,\n/static/cb7b1025c7567d8ecdb83d4d9573d5d7/5fd2a/IMG__0314.jpg 1400w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a>\n    <figcaption class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figcaption\">Technical Debt: we can choose to start paying it off, or incur more interest.</figcaption>\n  </figure></p>\n<p>Therefore, Mr Fowler plotted the attitudes people would have about such technical debts on a quadrant, segmenting between Prudent or Reckless, then Deliberate or Inadvertent.
